Programming in XSB -- an outline

(Should be organized by kind of application, so someone can turn
to chapter that describes something like what they want to do.)


Intro
Review of Prolog programming
  Prolog as nondeterministic procedural language with assign-once 
	variables 

Datalog programming
  "pure" deductive database examples

Grammars and parsing
  CFG's, (Earley recognition)
  first and follow
  PTQ example

Dynamic programming

Searching (games? see Bratko)

HiLog programming
  generic "Higher order programming": map, closure
  "Object oriented" programming, C-Logic variants

Aggregation and optimization - shortest path
  annotated logics and approximate reasoning

Metaprogramming -
  metainterpreters
  abstract interpretation examples - e.g. prop

Using XSB modules

Managing large extensional relations
  load_dyn, load_dync, cvt_canonical.
  Database interface, heterogeneous databases
  (defining views to merge DB's)

More on indexing

Table builtins - get_calls, get_returns

Extending XSB - foreign language interface
  calling XSB from C

Compiler options
